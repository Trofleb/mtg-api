"""Integration tests for Cards Search endpoint (/cards/search/{text}).

This module tests search endpoint functionality:
- Full-text search functionality
- Cursor-based pagination
- Response structure validation

NOTE: Filter tests (card_filter parameter) require additional work to pass
Pydantic models as query parameters in GET requests. These will be added in a
follow-up or the endpoint should be changed to POST for complex filters.

Test Categories:
1. Basic text search
2. Pagination tests
